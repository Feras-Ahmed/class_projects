A collection of assignments I completed for my Intro to Programming Class  at the University of Miami. 
Course Description: This Course covers the fundamentals of programming logic and structured programming principles including problem solving, algorithm design, and program development using C++. 
The course introduces the student to object-oriented programming through a study of the concepts of program specification and design, algorithm development, and coding and testing using a modern software development environment. 
Students learn how to write programs in an object-oriented high-level programming language (C++). 
Topics covered include fundamentals of algorithms, flowcharts, problem solving, programming concepts, classes and methods, control structures, arrays, and strings, pointers and data structures. 
Throughout the semester, problem solving skills will be stressed and applied to solving computing problems. Weekly assignments will provide hands-on experience in topics covered in this course.
